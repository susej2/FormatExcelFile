# Format Excel File
Simple project which helps to remove white spaces on the email and set upper or lower case the values of the cells from the select columns. 
Multiple columns can be selected. However I suggest to do it one by one. 
It also allows to export the excel file once that it was modified. 

This tool can be part of the ETL process from the BI perspective. This take place on the transform phase. 
Any improvement suggestion please add it into the comments.
